Hello, and welcome to my blog!

Several years ago, I used to keep a regular blog about life, politics, and
pedegogy, but when life got busy, I let the habit slip. This is my attempt
to get back into the habit of writing about my thoughts and sharing what I
learn.

Topics covered will include running, software development, travel, books, and
really anything else that I would like to publicly reflect on.
