The aim of this study is to develop surrogate models for quick, accurate prediction of thrust forces generated through flapping  fin  propulsion  for  given  operating  conditions  and  fin geometries.  Different  network  architectures  and  configurationsare   explored   to   model   the   training   data   separately   for   the lead  fin  and  rear  fin  of  a  tandem  fin  setup.  We  progressively improve  the  data  representation  of  the  input  parameter  space for model predictions. The models are tested on three unseen fin geometries and the predictions validated with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data. Finally, the orders of magnitude gains in computational performance of these surrogate models, comparedto  experimental  and  CFD  runs,  vs  their  tradeoff  with  accuracy is discussed within the context of this tandem fin configuration.
