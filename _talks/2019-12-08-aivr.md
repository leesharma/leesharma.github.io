Predicting 3D scene structure from a single image is a significant obstacle in fields such as autonomous robotic navigation, entertainment, and 3D modeling.  In the past several years, researchers have made promising strides in predicting 3D scenes from flat perspective images; however, little work has been done towards applying this to panoramic imagery.In this project, we develop a model for estimating depth and ego-motion from single cylindrical panoramic images.
